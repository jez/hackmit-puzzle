# HackMIT Puzzle 2014

Just a little repository where we can collaborate on code samples.

Currently, you can check out the [HACK-ASCII](/HACK-ASCII) directory to 
try and figure out what all these lines of random hex data mean. I've 
made a few tests to try different things, and the format of them should
become pretty apparent. I tried to write some doc strings.
